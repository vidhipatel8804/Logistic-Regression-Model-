# Logistic-Regression-Model

In this project, I utilized Logistic Regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The analysis included:

ðŸ“Š Data Exploration : Explored the dataset using various plots to analyze key features like age, gender, class, and fare, uncovering trends related to survival rates.  
ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing : Cleaned the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical features for better model performance.  
ðŸ”€ Feature Selection : Focused on critical features like 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', and 'Fare' to train the model.  
ðŸ“‰ Logistic Regression Modeling : Built and trained a Logistic Regression model to classify survival outcomes.  
ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation : Assessed the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC curve.  

Check out how predictive modeling can provide insights into survival probabilities on the Titanic! Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
